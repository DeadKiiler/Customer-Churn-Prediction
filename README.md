# Customer Churn Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn refers to customers who stop using a company’s service.  
This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will churn based on historical data.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze customer behavior
- Identify key factors influencing churn
- Build and evaluate a churn prediction model

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📊 Workflow
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Building
5. Model Evaluation

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

## 📈 Model Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Customers on month-to-month contracts have higher churn
- Longer tenure reduces churn probability
- Contract type and monthly charges are strong predictors
